# BERT re-ranking of MSMARCO documents
- [passages.ipynb](passages.ipynb): an adaptation of https://github.com/Tomjg14/Master_Thesis_MSMARCO_Passage_Reranking_BERT, which itself is an re-implementation of https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert.
- [documents.ipynb](documents.ipynb): document re-ranking, including setup.

For both notebooks, it is required to download the fine-tuned BERT model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cyUrhs7JaCJTTu-DjFUqP6Bs4f8a6JTX, and extract it to `model/BERT_Base_trained_on_MSMARCO`.
